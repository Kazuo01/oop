### .NET Framework

- .NET Framework, do Microsoft phát hành từ 2002, là nền tảng hỗ trợ phát triển các ứng dụng Windows và dịch vụ web.

Provide a consistent, object-oriented programming environment whether object code is stored and executed locally, executed locally but web-distributed, or executed remotely.

Provide a code-execution environment that:

Minimizes software deployment and versioning conflicts.

Promotes safe execution of code, including code created by an unknown or semi-trusted third party.

Eliminates the performance problems of scripted or interpreted environments.

Make the developer experience consistent across widely varying types of apps, such as Windows-based apps and Web-based apps.

Build all communication on industry standards to ensure that code based on .NET Framework integrates with any other code.

The .Net Framework supports more than 60 programming languages such as C#, F#, VB.NET, J#, VC++, JScript.NET, APL, COBOL, Perl, Oberon, ML, Pascal, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Python, Cobra, ADA, etc.


Following is the .NET framework Stack that shows the modules and components of the Framework.



### Ngôn ngữ lập trình C#
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.

C# is used for:

Mobile applications
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web services
Web sites
Games
VR
Database applications
And much, much more!
Why Use C#?
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It has a huge community support
C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa
