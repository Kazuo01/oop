What is C#?
C# is pronounced "C-Sharp".

It is an object-oriented programming language created by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework.

C# has roots from the C family, and the language is close to other popular languages like C++ and Java.

The first version was released in year 2002. The latest version, C# 8, was released in September 2019.

C# is used for:

Mobile applications
Desktop applications
Web applications
Web services
Web sites
Games
VR
Database applications
And much, much more!
Why Use C#?
It is one of the most popular programming language in the world
It is easy to learn and simple to use
It has a huge community support
C# is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
As C# is close to C, C++ and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C# or vice versa

## Nền tảng .NET

- .NET, do Microsoft phát triển, là nền tảng bao gồm các công cụ, ngôn ngữ lập trình và các thư viện dùng để tạo nhiều loại ứng dụng khác nhau. Phiên bản .NET đầu tiên phát hành năm 2020. 

- .NET Framework là một phần của .NET, là nền tảng dành cho phát triển các ứng dụng Windows.




There are various implementations of .NET. Each implementation allows .NET code to execute in different places—Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and many more.

.NET Framework is the original implementation of .NET. It supports running websites, services, desktop apps, and more on Windows.
.NET Core is a cross-platform implementation for running websites, services, and console apps on Windows, Linux, and macOS. .NET Core is open source on GitHub.
Xamarin/Mono is a .NET implementation for running apps on all the major mobile operating systems, including iOS and Android.
.NET Standard is a formal specification of the APIs that are common across .NET implementations. This allows the same code and libraries to run on different implementations.

.NET is a framework to develop software applications. It is designed and developed by Microsoft and the first beta version released in 2000.

It is used to develop applications for web, Windows, phone. Moreover, it provides a broad range of functionalities and support.

This framework contains a large number of class libraries known as Framework Class Library (FCL). The software programs written in .NET are executed in the execution environment, which is called CLR (Common Language Runtime). These are the core and essential parts of the .NET framework.

This framework provides various services like memory management, networking, security, memory management, and type-safety.

The .Net Framework supports more than 60 programming languages such as C#, F#, VB.NET, J#, VC++, JScript.NET, APL, COBOL, Perl, Oberon, ML, Pascal, Eiffel, Smalltalk, Python, Cobra, ADA, etc.

Following is the .NET framework Stack that shows the modules and components of the Framework.
